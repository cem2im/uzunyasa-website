# Data Collection Strategy — Why We Collect, What We Build

## The Core Insight

Every feature should collect data. Not to sell — to **understand the Turkish obesity landscape better than anyone else.**

This data becomes:
1. **Content fuel** — We know what people care about → we create that content
2. **Authority proof** — "Based on data from 50,000 Turkish users..."
3. **Product insight** — What tools/features to build next
4. **Research value** — Anonymized data for the annual "Türkiye Obezite Raporu"
5. **Strategic value** — Understanding patient decision patterns (which treatments they lean toward)
