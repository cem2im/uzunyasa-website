# Weight Management Platform — Master Roadmap v4

**Initiated:** 7 February 2026
**Last Updated:** 8 February 2026
**Owner:** Dr. Cem (behind the scenes)

## Vision

Build an **independent, national weight management platform** for Turkey — a trusted, evidence-based resource where millions of people can learn about weight loss, understand their treatment options, and make informed decisions.

The platform has no visible connection to any single doctor or clinic. It operates as an **independent authority**, potentially governed by a board of trustees (physicians, researchers, dietitians).

Over time, the platform becomes the go-to Turkish resource for weight management — and ESG naturally emerges as the balanced treatment option.

### Why Independent?

- **Trust:** Patients trust independent information more than a doctor's website selling a procedure
- **Scale:** A national resource can reach millions; a personal brand reaches thousands
- **Credibility:** A board of trustees signals authority, not marketing
- **SEO:** "Kilo yönetimi rehberi" ranks better than "Dr. X'in ESG kliniği"
- **Longevity:** The platform outlives any individual; it becomes an institution

### The Strategic Layer (Invisible to the Public)

## The Comparison Hub (Core Strategic Asset)

| Dimension | 💊 GLP-1 | 🔬 ESG | 🔪 Cerrahi |
|-----------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Kilo kaybı | %15-20 | %15-20 | %25-35 |
| Kalıcılık | Düşük (bırakınca geri alım) | Yüksek (yapısal) | Çok yüksek |
| İnvazivlik | Yok (iğne) | Minimal (endoskopik) | Yüksek (cerrahi) |
| İyileşme | Yok | 1-3 gün | 2-4 hafta |
| Geri dönüşümlülük | Tamamen | Büyük ölçüde | Geri dönüşü yok |
| Maliyet (uzun vadeli) | Yüksek (ömür boyu ilaç) | Tek seferlik | Tek seferlik |
| Yan etkiler | GI, bulantı, kas kaybı | Hafif, kısa süreli | Ciddi, uzun vadeli |
| Geri alım riski | Yüksek (bırakılınca) | Düşük | Düşük |

> When a patient reads this table on an independent platform, ESG looks like the obvious balanced choice — and they reached that conclusion themselves.
